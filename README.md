# BEES Data Engineering – Breweries Case

## Objective:

The goal of this test is to assess your skills in consuming data from an API, transforming and persisting it into a data lake following the medallion architecture with three layers: raw data, curated data partitioned by location, and an analytical aggregated layer.

## Instructions:

1. **API**: Use the Open Brewery DB API to fetch data. The API has an endpoint for listing breweries: <https://www.openbrewerydb.org/>

2. **Orchestration Tool**: Choose the orchestration tool of your preference (Airflow, Luigi, Mage, etc.) to build a data pipeline. We're interested in seeing your ability to handle scheduling, retries, and error handling in the pipeline.

3. **Language**: Use the language of your preference for the requests and data transformation. Please include test cases for your code. Python and PySpark are preferred but not mandatory.

4. **Containerization**: If you use Docker or Kubernetes for modularization, you'll earn extra points.

5. **Data Lake Architecture**: Your data lake must follow the medallion architecture having a bronze, silver, and gold layer:
   - **Bronze Layer**: Persist the raw data from the API in its native format or any format you find suitable.
   - **Silver Layer**: Transform the data to a columnar storage format such as parquet or delta, and partition it by brewery location. Please explain any other transformations you perform.
   - **Gold Layer**: Create an aggregated view with the quantity of breweries per type and location.

6. **Monitoring/Alerting**: Describe how you would implement a monitoring and alerting process for this pipeline. Consider data quality issues, pipeline failures, and other potential problems in your response.

7. **Repository**: Create a public repository on GitHub with your solution. Document your design choices, trade-offs, and provide clear instructions on how to run your application.

8. **Cloud Services**: If your solution requires any cloud services, please provide instructions on how to set them up. Please do not post them in your public repository.

## Evaluation Criteria:

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Code Quality
2. Solution Design
3. Efficiency
4. Completeness
5. Documentation
6. Error Handling

## Time Frame:

Please complete the test within 1 week and share the link to your GitHub repository with us.

_Remember, the goal of this test is to showcase your skills and approach to building a data pipeline. Good luck!_
